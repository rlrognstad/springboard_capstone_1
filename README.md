# springboard capstone 1
This repository contains data and scripts for my first capstone project in the [Springboard Data Science Career Track](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track/)

See miniprojects and exercises [here](https://github.com/rlrognstad/springboard)

## Contents:
1. [Initial project ideas](https://github.com/rlrognstad/springboard_capstone_1/blob/master/Capstone%20project%20ideas.md)
2. [Capstone proposal](https://github.com/rlrognstad/springboard_capstone_1/blob/master/Capstone%20proposal.md)
 
## Datasets:
The main dataset for this project is the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, avialible via [ftp](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars)

FARS data is recorded in absolute numbers of crashes, fatalities, etc.  For some analyses, these numbers were adjusted based on population or subpopulation size with data from the [US census](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/).


The FARS and census datasets use the [Geographic Locator Code](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104507) system to identify states and counties with numeric values.
